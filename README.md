# arduinoSimulink: Use MATLAB/Simulink with Arduino

This project intends to show the benefits of using MATLAB/Simulink to 
generate code for Arduino hardware. 
The project includes a Simulink library containing blocks for usage
of several common Arduino modules (f. i. LC-Display) and examples that
show how they can be used.

Have a look at the the [Wiki](https://github.com/RaphvK/arduinoSimulink/wiki "Wiki of arduinoSimulink") 
for more information and HowTos.

The [QuickStart Guide: LCD](https://github.com/RaphvK/arduinoSimulink/wiki/QuickStart-Guide:-LCD)
gives you a brief impression of how easily an LiquidCrystal-Display can be used in a Simulink model
that runs on an Arduino board using the "Arduino Drivers" library from this project.
